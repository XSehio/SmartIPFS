# SmartIPFS
A simple implementation of IPFS using truffle &amp; ganache with next.js
Truffle project is complete: it has all the files needed to compile it & run. Next.js project is not complete, I've just included the next.js config file
and the pages folder containing the source code. All the rest of directories that create a next.js file can be generated creating a project yourself.
